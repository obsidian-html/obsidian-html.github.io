# v2.1.0   
> Feature version of [v2.0.0](../Changelog/v2.0.0.md)   
   
## Graph view   
   
- There is now a full-page graph view   
- It is now possible to [write a custom graph view template](../Configurations/Styling/Writing%20a%20custom%20graph%20view%20template.md).   
- The default graph is now the 3d built-in template, based on [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph) instead of d3.js   
- For the 2d template:   
	- Auto zooming on current note and connected notes   
- In the note graph view right clicking now allows to select another note to more easily see its connections. In the full-page graph view the left/right click actions are reversed.   
   
## Call-outs   
> Added in this version   
   
- Achieved feature parity with Obsidian (as far as I can tell), but there might be some bugs/styling tweaks to be done in following patch versions.   
- Read more: [Implementing Call-outs](../Demonstrations/Implementing%20Call-outs.md)   
   
## Lifecycling   
   
- distutils copy_tree was deprecated, this was replaced with shutil copytree, but this gave issues on macOs so that was then replaced by a custom function based on shutil's copytree.   
   
## Bugfixes   
   
- When backlinks are turned off, a key not found error occurred at the AddCrosslinks() step.   
   
## Tweaks   
   
- TOC/Content panes were added in [v2.0.0](../Changelog/v2.0.0.md) there were some small implementation/styling tweaks done. Inline TOC is now a bit better styled, for example.
