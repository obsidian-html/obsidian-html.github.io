# Using the website   
The following features have been built in to the [various html templates](../Configurations/Styling/Styling.md#layouts).    
   
## Finding notes   
Use the [Graph view](../Configurations/Features/Graph%20view.md), [Backlinks](../Configurations/Features/Backlinks.md), or [Tags Page](../Configurations/Features/Tags%20Page.md) to find other notes, or just follow the links on the note that you're on.   
   
If your notes are very neatly organised in a folder structure, then the [Create Index from Directory Structure](../Configurations/Modes/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md) feature might also be something for you.   
   
## Header links   
Hover over any header to see a chain link icon. Clicking on this will send you to the page and scroll to the header location.   
   
## Graph view   
Read more [Graph View](../Configurations/Features/Graph%20view.md).   
   
## Tabbing system   
The default layout is `documentation`, which this site is built with. But for some people who are more into smart note taking, the [Tabs Layout](../Configurations/Styling/Tabs%20Layout.md) might be a better fit.
