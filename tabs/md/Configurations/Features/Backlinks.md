# Backlinks   
   
> This is the documentation for [v3.5.0](../../Changelog/v3.5.0.md) and lower, for documentation for **v4.0.0** and higher, see [https://obsidian-html.github.io/v4](https://obsidian-html.github.io/v4)   
   
Notice on each page of this site, each note ends with a backlinks section.    
   
This does not come from the vault notes, but is computed and added in by ObsidianHtml. You can turn this off if you don't like this behavior.
