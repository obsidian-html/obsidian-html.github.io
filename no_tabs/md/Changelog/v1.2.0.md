# v1.2.0   
> Feature version of [v1.0.0](../Changelog/v1.0.0.md).   
   
## Added features   
   
- [Relative_path_html](../Configurations/Relative_path_html.md) mode   
	- Can be used to compile to HTML for which you don't need to run a http server to view the site (for local/personal use).   
- [NoTabs Mode](../Configurations/NoTabs%20Mode.md)   
	- Added to make relative_path_html mode feasible / tidy up the code. But can be used to get a more simple browsing experience.
