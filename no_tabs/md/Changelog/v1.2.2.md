# v1.2.2   
> bugfix for [v1.2.0](../Changelog/v1.2.0.md)   
   
## Bugfixes    
Bugfix for a little bug where a halting error occurs when [toggles/verbose_printout](../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#verbose_printout) is true, due to a faulty concatenation in a print statement somewhere. [See also](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/pull/203).   
   
Also added a [regression test](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/204) for this.   
   
## Config changes   
Removed the behavior where [Relative_path_html](../Configurations/Relative_path_html.md) automatically disabled [Graph view](../Configurations/Graph%20view.md) and enables [NoTabs Mode](../Configurations/NoTabs%20Mode.md). (Read more about this on the Relative_path_html page).
