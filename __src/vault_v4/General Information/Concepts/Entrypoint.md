The entrypoint is the note configured to be the homepage for the markdown/html output. It will always be renamed to `index.md`, `index.html` so that it is recognized by the browser.

- Due to the rename, you can't have a note named `/index.md` if it is not the entrypoint. See also [[Common issues & Limitations]]
