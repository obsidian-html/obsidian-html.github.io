When the [[Styling#Layouts|styling layout setting]] is set to `tabs`, the html output uses a tab system, where each internal link opens a new note on the right of the parent note. 

You can view this site in tabs layout [here](https://obsidian-html.github.io/tabs/).

This layout is for people who use the smart note taking / zettelkasten methods, where dense linkage is prefered over giving a strict structure from the get-go. It allows to have multiple notes open at one time, and to scroll back and forth, following a thread of related notes.

### Scrolling notes
When you open a whole chain of notes, you'll be scrolled rightward to keep up.
- To move back to the beginning, keeping all notes open, press `1` (and `2` for the next one, and so forth).
- To move back to the beginnning, closing all notes, click on the link in the top left (ObsidianHtml/Documentation).
- To move left/right by one note, press `,` or `.`

Of course, the scrollbar and arrow keys are also available as methods of navigation.

### Closing tabs
When you click on a new link in an earlier tab, all the open tabs after it will be closed.

### Notice the url
There is a `?path=` part in the link that allows you to open the same set of tabs after a refresh.
