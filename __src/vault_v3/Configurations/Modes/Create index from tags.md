If you want to build an index note on the fly, based on selected tags, you can use this feature.

The basic outline is this:
- Select the tags on which you want to match notes, each tag will get its own header
- Select the sort order, for which order you want the notes to appear under each header
- Select the placement of the notes that were matched on the selected tags, but did not have a value for the criterium that you selected for the sort (on top or on bottom).

To enable this setting, [[Copy vault to temp dir]] must be **enabled**. This is because for this feature to work, it has to create a note in the [[Configuration Options#obsidian_folder_path_str|obsidian_folder_path]], and this path will be the user's actual vault when copy vault to temp dir is disabled.

## Example
You can view an index that is created in this way under [/index_from_tags](/index_from_tags). 

> Fun fact: we co-published this version of the website next to the main website using the [[Configuration Options#Html Url Prefix]] setting!

## Minimal configuration
Don't be intimidated by the configuration settings for this feature, in it's minimal form, this would be enough to enable it:

``` yaml
toggles
  features:
    create_index_from_tags:
      enabled: True
      tags: [my_tag, my_other_tag]
```
