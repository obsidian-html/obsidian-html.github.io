# Using the website
The following features have been built in to the [[Styling#Layouts|various html templates]]. 

## Finding notes
Use the [[Graph view]], [[Backlinks]], or [[Tags Page]] to find other notes, or just follow the links on the note that you're on.

If your notes are very neatly organised in a folder structure, then the [[Create Index from Directory Structure]] feature might also be something for you.

## Header links
Hover over any header to see a chain link icon. Clicking on this will send you to the page and scroll to the header location.

## Graph view
Read more [[Graph view|Graph View]].

## Tabbing system
The default layout is `documentation`, which this site is built with. But for some people who are more into smart note taking, the [[Tabs Layout]] might be a better fit.
