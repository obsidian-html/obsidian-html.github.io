> Patch version of [[v3.2.0]]. 

## Changes
- Made `force_filename_to_lowercase` default to true, as markdown links in a vault had the same issue as when converting markdown directly, while working as intended in Obsidian itself. 

## Bugfixes
- The change in [[v3.2.1]] to fix links with parentheses not being parsed correctly created the bug that when having () around a link, like ([[v3.2.1]]), would cause the trailing `)` to be included in the link. This has been fixed.
- Anchor links like `[go to chapter](#chapter)` would cause a breaking bug because of using `link[0]` instead of `link.startswith()`. (Former will give an out of bounds error when string is empty). This was also a piece of code that didn't need to be run for anchor links, this has been corrected as well.
