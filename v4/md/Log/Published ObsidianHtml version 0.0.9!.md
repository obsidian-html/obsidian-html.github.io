# Published ObsidianHtml version 0.0.9!   
   
   
Lots of new features, like: graph view, backlinks, index from tags, image scaling, temporary vault copy.    
   
We made these features configurable: folder exclusion, external link behavior, css/js inclusions. And of course we added a lot of bugfixes.   
   
Next version is going to be again a slew of new features, but also a strong focus on putting everything in its place, and having a place for everything, to (hopefully) get a version that sees less changes in the output and config structures.   
   
If this succeeds, we'll finally make the jump to version 1.0.0! ðŸŽ‰
