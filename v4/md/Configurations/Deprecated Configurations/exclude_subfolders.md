# exclude_subfolders   
   
> Deprecated starting with [v3.4.0](/not_created.md)   
   
This has been deprecated for `exclude_glob`.   
The name was a bit confusing now that it is also possible to exclude files.   
   
   
- If `exclude_subfolders` is set, and it is a list, it's value will be copied internally to `exclude_glob` for the duration of the deprecation
