# Breadcrumbs   
   
Breadcrumbs have been added.   
   
![](../../Resources/img/Pasted%20image%2020220909145416.png)   
   
These provide the path to the note. These interopt with [Folder Notes](../../Configurations/Features/Folder%20Notes.md), in order to make folders clickable. I do not recommend using breadcrumbs without that feature.   
   
To enable, set this setting in your config.yml:   
``` yaml
toggles:
  features:
    breadcrumbs:
      enabled: True
```
