# Create index from tags   
   
   
If you want to build an index note on the fly, based on selected tags, you can use this feature.   
   
The basic outline is this:   
   
- Select the tags on which you want to match notes, each tag will get its own header   
- Select the sort order, for which order you want the notes to appear under each header   
- Select the placement of the notes that were matched on the selected tags, but did not have a value for the criterium that you selected for the sort (on top or on bottom).   
   
To enable this setting, [Copy vault to temp dir](../../Configurations/Modes/Copy%20vault%20to%20temp%20dir.md) must be **enabled**. This is because for this feature to work, it has to create a note in the [obsidian_folder_path](../../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#obsidian_folder_path_str), and this path will be the user's actual vault when copy vault to temp dir is disabled.   
   
## Example   
You can view an index that is created in this way under [/index_from_tags](/index_from_tags).    
   
> Fun fact: we co-published this version of the website next to the main website using the [Configuration Options](../../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#html-url-prefix) setting!   
   
## Minimal configuration   
Don't be intimidated by the configuration settings for this feature, in it's minimal form, this would be enough to enable it:   
   
``` yaml
toggles
  features:
    create_index_from_tags:
      enabled: True
      tags: [my_tag, my_other_tag]
```
