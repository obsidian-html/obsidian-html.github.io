> New in [v1.0.0](/not_created.md)   
   
If you want to build an index note on the fly, where it just shows the directory structure of the html output, then you can enable this feature.   
   
By default this feature is turned on, but it will only create a new page at location [/obs.html/dir_index.html](/obs.html/dir_index.html), which is accessible via the dirtree icon in the top right of the page.   
   
> Note: As opposed to [Create index from tags](../../Configurations/Modes/Create%20index%20from%20tags.md), this is not a note selection feature. This is an HTML-only addon that creates a new html page to the HTML output folder, like the [Tags Page](../../Configurations/Features/Tags%20Page.md) feature. [Overwriting the homepage](../../Configurations/Modes/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md#overwrite-the-homepage) is optional, and not the default setting.   
   
## Example   
You can view an index that is created in this way under [/obs.html/dir_index.html](/obs.html/dir_index.html). This is the default location.    
   
## Disable the feature   
This feature can take some time to process, especially on older machines. To disable it, simply add this to your config:   
   
``` yaml
toggles:
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: False
```
   
   
## Disable the icon   
If you like having the dirtree index, but you don't like the icon, then you can disable it by adding this to your config:   
   
``` yaml
toggles:
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      styling: 
        show_icon: False
```
   
   
## Exclude folders/files   
There is a good chance that you will want to exclude folders and/or files from being shown on the dirtree index page. This is our configuration, for reference:   
   
``` yaml 
toggles:
  features:
	create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
      rel_output_path: 'obs.html/dir_index.html'
      styling: 
        show_icon: True
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "__src"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
        - "Resources"
      exclude_files:
        - "favicon.ico"
        - "not_created.html"
```
   
   
The defaults for these settings can be found via [Configuration Options#Get all the default settings](../../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#get-all-the-default-settings). At the time of writing these are:   
   
```yaml
toggles:
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
      verbose: False
      rel_output_path: 'obs.html/dir_index.html'
      styling: 
        show_icon: True
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
      exclude_files:
        - "favicon.ico"
        - "not_created.html"
```
   
   
### Glob patterns   
> Added in [v3.3.0](/not_created.md). Note this only applies to this feature, not the general exclude_folders setting!   
   
Starting with [v3.3.0](/not_created.md) you can now use glob pattern in the `exclude_subfolders` and `exclude_files` settings.    
   
For example, to exclude all folders called `Assets`, use:   
   
```yaml
toggles:
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
        - "**/Assets"
```
   
   
> Note that you need to list the default values too, because we are overwriting the default settings by providing a value.   
   
To troubleshoot your glob pattern, you can [Verbose](#verbose)   
   
### Overwrite the homepage   
If you want to use the index generated by this feature as your homepage, then a configuration like this might work for you:   
   
```yaml
toggles:
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      enabled: True
      rel_output_path: 'index.html'
      styling: 
        show_icon: False
      exclude_subfolders:
        - ".git"
        - "__src"
        - "md"
        - "obs.html"
      exclude_files:
        - "favicon.ico"
        - "not_created.html"
        - "index.html"
```
   
   
Note the `rel_output_path` setting. This can also be set to any subpath of the [html_output_folder](../../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#html_output_folder_path_str) that you wish. The parent folders are automatically created when necessary.    
   
## Verbose   
There is a global verbosity setting that will make this feature print out extra information. This will print out a lot of info though, so you can also just enable verbosity on just this feature by setting:   
   
```yaml
toggles:
  features:
    create_index_from_dir_structure:
      verbose: True
```
