# Changes   
   
## Breaking changes   
### It is no longer allowed to run `obsidianhtml` without command   
Previously (with deprecation warning), not passing in a command would have the CLI assume that you meant `convert`. Starting from this version, the CLI will exit if not explicitly stated what you want to do.   
   
## `obsidianhtml run` is removed   
`obsidianhtml run` was meant as an easy way for beginners to get an export setup, and to immediately view it in their browser. The better approach though would be to run `obsidianhtml convert` to export your vault to html, and then in a different terminal run a webserver, such as with `obsidianhtml serve`.    
   
The `-f`, `-o`, and `--subfolder` toggles from `obsidianhtml run` have been ported over to `obsidianhtml convert`, to easily get started without a `config.yml`.   
   
### exclude_subfolders is removed as a setting
