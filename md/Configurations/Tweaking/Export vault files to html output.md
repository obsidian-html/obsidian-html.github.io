# Export vault files to html output


> New in [v3.2.0](/not_created.md)

## Configuration
``` yaml
file_exports:
  - encoding: binary
    src: Resources/Includes/favicon.ico
    dst: favicon.ico
  - encoding: utf-8
    src: Resources/Includes/christmas_snowflakes.js
    dst: obs.html/static/christmas_snowflakes.js
```


This will export the files in the vault to the html_output_folder.

### Paths
Source paths are relative to the vault path (as configured in `obsidian_folder_path_str`). When `copy_vault_to_tempdir` is enabled, this will be a temporary directory with the same contents as the folder configured on `obsidian_folder_path_str`.

Dest paths are relative to the folder  `html_output_folder_path_str`.

You can go outside of these folder if you wish by providing absolute paths:
```
file_exports:
  - encoding: binary
    src: /home/username/Downloads/favicon.ico
    dst: favicon.ico
```


### Encoding
The default encoding of `utf-8` can be omitted:

``` yaml
file_exports:
  - src: Resources/Includes/christmas_snowflakes.js
    dst: obs.html/static/christmas_snowflakes.js
```
