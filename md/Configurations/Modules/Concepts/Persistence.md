# Persistence

Modules are by default removed after they are run. In some cases, the modules need to be stored for later execution.

## Use case examples
One example is the [Resource Logger](../../../Configurations/Modules/Resource%20Logger.md) module, which is executed after every module execution (as it is configured as a [Meta module](../../../Configurations/Modules/Concepts/Meta%20module.md)). At the very end, it is run as a normal module to output all of the information that it collected. If persistence were off, the collected data would be lost every run, necessitating writes/reads for every module execution, which is a bit excessive.

## Configuring persistence
You can add `persistence: True` to the module listing, e.g.:

``` yaml
module_list:
  preparation:
    - name: html_templater
      description: Prepare and export templates used to create html output.
      persistent: True
```
