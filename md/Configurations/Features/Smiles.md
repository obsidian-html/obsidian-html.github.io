# Smiles

> New in [v4.0.0](../../Changelog/v4.0.0.md)

This feature recreates the functionality (as best we can) of the Obsidian module: [https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem](https://github.com/Acylation/obsidian-chem)

It uses the same package to achieve this, [https://github.com/reymond-group/smilesDrawer](https://github.com/reymond-group/smilesDrawer)
