# NoTabs Mode


> New in version [v1.2.0](/not_created.md)
> **Removed in version [v2.0.0](/not_created.md)**

This setting has been removed:
``` yaml
toggles:
  no_tabs: True
```


In favor of the new layout setting. Read more here: [Styling](../../Configurations/Styling/Styling.md#layouts).

In short, use:
``` yaml
toggles:
  features:
    styling: 
      layout: documentation
```


To opt out of tabbing. (Opting out is also not longer needed because documentation is now the default layout).
