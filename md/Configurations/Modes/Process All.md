# Process All


## Crawling versus converting all nodes
This package was written with the idea that [you give one note that will serve as the homepage](../../Configurations/Modes/Modes.md#entrypoint-mode). Then all the notes that are linked directly or indirectly by that first note are processed, ignoring what else might still be in your vault.

Process all is a [mode](../../Configurations/Modes/Modes.md), which will tell ObsidianHtml to convert and include all notes in the output. 

This has become more useful because of the new [Graph view](../../Configurations/Features/Graph%20view.md) and [Tags Page](../../Configurations/Features/Tags%20Page.md) features. These can make those notes reachable now. 

See [Configuration Options](../../Configurations/Configuration%20Options.md#process-all) for how to enable this setting.
