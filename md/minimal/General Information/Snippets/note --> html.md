Default way that obisidianhtml works. We take a vault as input, then compile proper markdown, and then compile the html from that compiled markdown.   
   
To compile html from __existing__ markdown, as if we compiled it from a vault, see [md --> html](../../General%20Information/Snippets/md%20--%3E%20html.md).
