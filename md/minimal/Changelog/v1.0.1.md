# v1.0.1   
   
Patch version of [v1.0.0](../Changelog/v1.0.0.md).   
   
## Bugfixes   
### Overwriting index with the dirtree feature causes graph view to not work   
It is permitted when using [Create Index from Directory Structure](../Configurations/Modes/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md) to overwrite the index.html.    
   
In the previous version of ObsidianHtml, the graph.js does not get loaded into the homepage created by this feature, which causes the graph view to not work at all when starting from the homepage (which will be 99% of all traffic).   
   
This is fixed in this patch update.
