# Working on an RSS feed for ObsidianHtml

No self-publishing system should go without an RSS feed.

That's why we are working on a new feature that will generate an RSS feed for you automatically when you push your website.

Keep track of the status of this feature, and pitch ideas here: [Compile RSS Feed](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/21).

### Update
This feature is done: [RSS Feed](../Configurations/Features/RSS%20Feed.md)
