# Implementing Call-outs

> Added in [v2.1.0](/not_created.md)

Call-outs are a way to have a bit more flavor than the standard blockquote. They can also fold in, allowing you to tuck away long-winded examples to a collapsible section.

This feature is implemented as good as perfectly from Obsidian, so look [over there](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts) also for configuration information.

This page will service mostly as a demonstration and to show the style that we use (which at the time of writing is pretty much exactly the same as the dark theme on Obsidian).

## Configurations
### Normal note
``` markdown
> [!note]
> This is a note block
```


> [!note]
> This is a note block

### Folded note
``` markdown
> [!note]- Folded
> This is a folded note block. It is closed by default.

> [!note]+ Unfolded, but foldable
> This is a folded note block. It is unfolded by default.
```


> [!note]- Folded
> This is a folded note block. It is closed by default.

> [!note]+ Unfolded, but foldable
> This is a folded note block. It is unfolded by default.

### Custom title
``` markdown
> [!note]- Custom callout title
> This is a folded note block with a custom title
```

> [!note]- Custom callout title
> This is a folded note block with a custom title

### Multi paragraph
Continue the block with a `>`, like so:
``` markdown
> [!note]
> This is a note block.
>
> It has two paragraphs.
```

> [!note]
> This is a note block.
>
> It has two paragraphs.


## Single line call-outs
```
> [!warning] This is just a warning. No content
```


> [!warning] This is just a warning. No content



## Types

- Instead of `[!note]` you can use any other name
- If a type is not known it will get the styling of the note callout type (unless you have added your own css).
