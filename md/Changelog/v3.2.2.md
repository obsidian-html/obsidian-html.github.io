# v3.2.2   
   
> Patch version of [v3.2.0](../Changelog/v3.2.0.md).    
   
## Changes   
   
- Made `force_filename_to_lowercase` default to true, as markdown links in a vault had the same issue as when converting markdown directly, while working as intended in Obsidian itself.    
   
## Bugfixes   
   
- The change in [v3.2.1](../Changelog/v3.2.1.md) to fix links with parentheses not being parsed correctly created the bug that when having () around a link, like ([v3.2.1](../Changelog/v3.2.1.md)), would cause the trailing `)` to be included in the link. This has been fixed.   
- Anchor links like `[go to chapter](#chapter)` would cause a breaking bug because of using `link[0]` instead of `link.startswith()`. (Former will give an out of bounds error when string is empty). This was also a piece of code that didn't need to be run for anchor links, this has been corrected as well.
