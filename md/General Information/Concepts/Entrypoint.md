# Entrypoint

The entrypoint is the note configured to be the homepage for the markdown/html output. It will always be renamed to `index.md`, `index.html` so that it is recognized by the browser.

- By default only the links found in the entrypoint are followed (recursively), to export all notes, see [Process All](../../Configurations/Modes/Process%20All.md)
- Due to the rename, you can't have a note named `/index.md` if it is not the entrypoint. See also [Common issues & Limitations](../../General%20Information/Common%20issues%20%26%20Limitations.md)
