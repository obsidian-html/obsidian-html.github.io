> Feature version of [v3.0.0](../Changelog/v3.0.0.md).    
   
# Added   
   
- `included_folders` now allows a user to select the folders from the vault to include, the rest is "excluded". See also [#451](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/451).   
- `exclude_subfolders`  now also supports glob patterns. This affects both the copying step to the temporary folder, and the file tree generator (for when copying to temp dir is turned off).   
- Image titles can now be added alongside scaling, use for example:   
``` md
  ![cat|100](200w.gif)
  ![[200w.gif|cat|100]]
```
   
   
  - Inclusions are now shown in the graph view with dotted edges. See also [#425](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/425).   
	  - Can be turned off with:   
	  ``` yaml   
      graph:   
        show_inclusions_in_graph: False   
	  ```   
   
- [Note settings](../Configurations/Note%20settings/Note%20settings.md) expanded, have a browse there.   
- Added `homepage_label` to [Create Index from Directory Structure](../Configurations/Modes/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md) to overwrite the `index` list item to e.g. `My homepage`.   
- All localStorage calls are now wrapped to fail gracefully to allow a visitor to disable javascript if the compiled website is properly configured. See [#352](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/352).   
- Folders with an associated [folder note](../Configurations/Features/Folder%20Notes.md) can now also be closed in the dirtree pane created by [Create Index from Directory Structure](../Configurations/Modes/Create%20Index%20from%20Directory%20Structure.md). See [#469](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/469).   
   
# Features   
   
- [Side panes](../Configurations/Features/Side%20panes.md) feature was added. For this, the [Create index from tags](../Configurations/Modes/Create%20index%20from%20tags.md) feature was modernized to be able to properly provide content for either side pane.   
   
   
# Bugfixes   
   
- Fixed: [Obsidian links not parsed correctly when parentheses are present without a space](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/532)   
- Fixed: [Empty embed links cause a crash](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/536).    
	- Changed this so it just creates an empty img tag.   
- Fixed: [ImportError: cannot import name 'UnescapeTreeprocessor' from 'markdown.treeprocessors'](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/474).    
	- Added minimum requirement for markdown in setup.cfg.   
- Fixed: [Inline tags and code blocks not working in footnotes](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/512)   
- Fixed: [Imagescaling regression](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/515)   
- Fixed: [Table column borders are missing every other column](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/511)   
- Fixed: [General latex parsing bug](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/521)   
	- Latex was not properly treated as a code block, resulting in a whole family of potential bugs where obsidianhtml would edit the latex code block before it could be parsed by python-markdown/latex.js   
- Fixed: [Single-line callouts don't work](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/488)   
- Fixed: [Scrollbar missing in contents pane](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/496)   
- Fixed: [Bug where includable files were not copied to html output](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/465)   
   
# Changes   
   
- Alterations in [Create index from tags](../Configurations/Modes/Create%20index%20from%20tags.md)   
- Alterations in [Embedded note title](../Configurations/Features/Embedded%20note%20title.md) to accomodate changes in Obsidian   
- Enabling glob support required that values in `exclude_subfolders`  now should start with a slash when excluding a specific folder. Excluding any folder with the given name, the starting slash should be dropped.
