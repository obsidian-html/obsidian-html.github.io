> Patch version of [v3.2.0](../Changelog/v3.2.0.md).    
   
This could've been a feature version, but I published this mainly to fix major bugs in [v3.2.0](../Changelog/v3.2.0.md).   
   
## Added features   
   
- We make more use of retries. When a file is not found it will be looked for again by either prepending a '/' or by removing it. When copying included files over, we no longer try to deduce whether we should add '.md', we just try to find the file with and without the added suffix.   
- Added `md_source_host_urls` to remove prefixes from urls. This is only usefull for [md --> html](../General%20Information/Snippets/md%20--%3E%20html.md) conversion.   
``` yaml
# Used to strip the http url hostpart of a link to get a relative link
# e.g. for value "https://git.com/user/repo/-/wikis/mywiki/" then:
#   "https://git.com/user/repo/-/wikis/mywiki/folder/markdown.md" --> /folder/markdown.md
md_source_host_urls: []
```
   
   
- Added `toggles/force_filename_to_lowercase` to make sure that markdown files with capitals are found.    
``` yaml
toggles:
  # gitlab is case insensitive, this setting should be true when converting a wiki from that source
  # note that this does not impact the output, Hello.md will be written to Hello.html
  force_filename_to_lowercase: False
```
   
   
## Bugfixes   
   
- The warning module import was removed in the last version by mistake. This would cause a crash if it would warn about an external image not being imported.   
- `obsidian serve` would give `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory` errors after a rerun of `obsidian convert` (because the folder it was hosting would've been temporarily removed). [This was fixed](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/issues/398).   
- A valid md link of `[test](this_is_a_(long)_link.md)` was being parsed as `this_is_a_(long` instead of `this_is_a_(long)_link.md`. Fixed by requiring no spaces in link, which is conform spec.
