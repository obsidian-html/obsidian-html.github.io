You can create an `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_inline-tag}` by typing # and then immediately some text (without a space). This will then be picked up in the list at the bottom of the page, and it will also be a clickable link in the note when you have the following setting configured:    
   
``` yaml
toggles:
  # Will preserve inline tags. This will give polluted markdown output
  preserve_inline_tags: True
```
