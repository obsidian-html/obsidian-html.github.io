# v3.0.2   
> Patch version of [v3.0.0](../Changelog/v3.0.0.md)   
   
Removed `md_globals` from built-in python-markdown extensions.    
   
This solves the `TypeError: MermaidExtension.extendMarkdown() missing 1 required positional argument: 'md_globals'` error that was introduced when python-markdown 3.4 was published. (We were using a deprecated way of initializing our extensions).
