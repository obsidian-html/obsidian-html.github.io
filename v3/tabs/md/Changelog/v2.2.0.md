# v2.2.0   
> Feature version of [v2.0.0](../Changelog/v2.0.0.md)   
   
## Search    
> New in this version   
    
Search has been added. Click on the looking glass icon in the icon tray to open search.   
   
The search will be expanded upon in the next versions, but for now the search works well enough to be enabled by default.   
   
To disable the search, add this to your config.yml:   
``` yaml
toggles:
  features:
    search:
      enabled: False
```
   
   
## Mathjax   
> New in this version   
   
A subset of Latex has been added that can render mathematical equations in a pretty way. Read more here: [Implementing Latex](../Demonstrations/Implementing%20Latex.md)   
   
## Bugfixes   
   
- The `max_note_width` setting did not do anything because callouts.css included a width setting that it shouldn't have, this has been corrected.   
- Regex bug for image links fixed   
	- For code like `![](link) some text (with parentheses on the same line)`, the regex would match everything until the last `)`. This was wrong obviously, so this was fixed.
